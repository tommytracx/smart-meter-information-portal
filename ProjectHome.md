The Smart Meter Information Portal is an online environment that assists with the collection, preservation, access and visualization of the data from smart meter devices. The project that developed this portal was funded by the Australian National Data Service (<a href='http://www.ands.org.au/'>www.ands.org.au</a>). The portal was developed by members of the eResearch Services Team at <a href='http://www.griffith.edu.au/'>Griffith University</a>, Australia.
